# Jinn's Whiskey Bar 
Take a drink from my personal whiskey collection. `20 ea`

## Suntory Hibiki Harmony
Japanese whiskeys are so hot that demand has been outpacing supply. This famous Hibiki has fruity notes, a burn, and a pleasant sweet aftertaste.  

## Nikka Coffey Grain
Sweet notes and a full bodied finish, this was my favorite when I went whiskey tasting at Bar Jackalope. Coffey grains doesnt mean its aged in coffee barrels, but the coffee notes are mysteriously there. 

## Ardbeg 10 years
Do you like smokiness? This takes the smokiness of mezcals and puts it in an Irish whiskey. Brings you straight to a campfire. 

## Isle of Skye 12 Years
Caught my eye with a rare 98 official rating.  This one has just the right hints peat, smoke, and burn, and is exceedingly smooth, I get the hype.  

## Oban 14 Years
Very complex with a full bodied finish, this one hits you with flavor. This is complex and balanced and I love it. 

## Glenfidditch 14 Years
Very peaty, as Glenfidditch does. This one has a complex, herbal, and smoky taste with hints of oak.
