# Jinn's Whiskey Bar 
Take a drink from my personal whiskey collection. `20 ea`

### Hibiki Harmony
Japanese whiskeys are so hot that demand has been outpacing supply. The famous Hibiki has fruity notes, a burn, and a pleasant sweet aftertaste.  

### Nikka Coffey Grain
Sweet notes and a full bodied finish, this was my favorite when I went whiskey tasting at Bar Jackalope. Coffey grain doesnt mean aged in coffee barrels, but the coffee notes are mysteriously there. 

### Isle of Skye 12 Years
Caught my eye with a rare 98 official rating.  This one has just the right hints peat, smoke, and burn, and is exceedingly smooth, I get the hype.  

### Oban 14 Years
Complex with a full bodied finish, this one hits you with flavor. It's balanced and I love it. 

### Glenfidditch 14 Years
Very peaty, as Glenfidditch does. This one has a complex, herbal, and smoky taste with hints of oak.
